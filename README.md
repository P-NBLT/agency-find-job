[Find out the latest working version here.](https://agency-find-job.vercel.app/)

This application allows you to look for agencies that are hiring developers in the Netherlands. The coming version will add a dashboard for the user where he can change his password and see if his request have been accepted or rejected. 
User, if logged in can add, modify or delete agencies. Those actions are then sent to the admin section waiting for approval.
